      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Content Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Companies with a global workforce often search for translating their training modules or eLearning content. The current content around this topic usually lists benefits of training localization (improved retention, compliance, etc.) but can be high-level. Many providers emphasize that employees learn better in their native language – indeed, studies confirm people “absorb and retain information more effectively” when training is in their first language (Why Translate Training for Your Employees | Articulate). However, the content gap lies in actionable guidance: how to implement eLearning translation effectively. For example, existing blogs might say “localize images and examples” or “ensure cultural relevance” in a brief way, but they don’t walk a B2B training manager through the process of converting an entire training program (videos, quizzes, slides) into multiple languages. Additionally, topics like LMS integration of translated content, maintaining SCORM compliance, or using voice-over vs. subtitling in training videos are not thoroughly addressed in search results.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">How Ladon Can Fill It</h2>
      <p>
        Ladon could create a comprehensive guide or webinar-style article titled “Translating Corporate Training for a Global Team: A Step-by-Step Guide.” This content should bridge the gap by combining the why and the how. It can start with compelling data (e.g. “nearly 60% of remote workers are on globally distributed teams” (Why Translate Training for Your Employees | Articulate), emphasizing the need for multilingual training) and a brief recap of benefits (better knowledge retention and compliance through native-language training). The meat of the article, however, should be an actionable framework: how Ladon approaches eLearning translation. For instance, outline steps like content audit (identifying which courses or modules to translate for maximum impact), text extraction from eLearning authoring tools, multimedia localization (graphics, narration, captions), and re-integration/testing to ensure the translated course runs smoothly. Ladon can highlight often-missed details, such as adjusting assessments to account for cultural differences or reading direction (if translating into RTL languages). By providing tips (like using bilingual glossaries to keep technical training terms consistent) and noting Ladon’s experience (maybe a mini-case study of a client who translated safety training into 5 languages), the article would far surpass the generic “importance of training translation” posts. It positions Ladon as an expert in not just translation, but in the learning & development aspect of multilingual training – exactly what a B2B professional would be searching for.
